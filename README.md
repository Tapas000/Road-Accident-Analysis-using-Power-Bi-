# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The dashboard provides insights into road accidents based on various parameters, including casualty types, vehicle types, road types, and weather conditions.

## Features
- **Total Casualties & Accidents**: Displays the count of casualties and accidents for the current year (CY) along with percentage changes.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Breakdown of casualties based on the type of vehicle involved.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Analysis of accidents occurring on different road types (single carriageway, roundabouts, etc.).
- **Casualties by Location**: A geographic visualization of accident locations.
- **Casualties in Rural vs. Urban Areas**: Comparison of accident occurrences in rural and urban settings.
- **Impact of Weather Conditions**: Filters available to analyze accidents based on different weather conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Dataset**: Road accident data collected from various sources.
